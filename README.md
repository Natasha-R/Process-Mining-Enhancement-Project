# Process Mining: Enhancement Project

The aim of this work was to apply the concept of "Enhancement" to a provided event log, for the final project of the TH KÃ¶ln module "Process Mining" (https://digital-sciences.de/en/modules/process-mining/) as part of the Digital Sciences Master's Degree. 

The event log is from the BPI Challenge 2019, and contains data on the purchase order process of a real company.  More information about the dataset can be found here: https://icpmconference.org/2019/icpm-2019/contests-challenges/bpi-challenge-2019/.

The specific research questions investigated in the project related to the time perspective of enhancement:  
**What is the distribution of throughput times and why do these throughput times vary?**  
The slides used for the final project presentation are available here:  
(The research questions are investigated from page 16 onwards).

The Jupyter notebooks containing the project code are:
* [1. Filtering the Event Log]()
* [2. Pre-Processing the Event Log for Modelling]()
* [3. Exploring the Processed Dataset]()
* [4. Modelling Throughput]()

Further analysis was also completed using ProM (https://promtools.org/) and Celonis (https://www.celonis.com/), the details of which are described in the presentation slides.
