# Process Mining: Enhancement Project

The aim of this work was to apply the concept of "Enhancement" to a provided event log, for the final project of the TH KÃ¶ln module "Process Mining" (https://digital-sciences.de/en/modules/process-mining/) as part of the Digital Sciences Master's Degree. 

The event log is from the BPI Challenge 2019, and contains data on the purchase order process of a real company.  More information about the dataset can be found here: https://icpmconference.org/2019/icpm-2019/contests-challenges/bpi-challenge-2019/.

The specific research questions investigated in the project related to the time perspective of enhancement:  
**What is the distribution of throughput times and why do these throughput times vary?**  
The slides used for the final project presentation are available here: https://github.com/Natasha-R/Process-Mining-Enhancement-Project/blob/main/ProcessEnhancementProjectPresentation.pdf  
(The research questions are investigated from page 16 onwards).

The Jupyter notebooks containing the project code are:
* [1. Filtering the Event Log](https://github.com/Natasha-R/Process-Mining-Enhancement-Project/blob/main/1.%20Filtering%20the%20Event%20Log.ipynb)
* [2. Pre-Processing the Event Log for Modelling](https://github.com/Natasha-R/Process-Mining-Enhancement-Project/blob/main/2.%20Pre-Processing%20the%20Event%20Log%20for%20Modelling.ipynb)
* [3. Exploring the Processed Dataset](https://github.com/Natasha-R/Process-Mining-Enhancement-Project/blob/main/3.%20Exploring%20the%20Processed%20Dataset.ipynb)
* [4. Modelling Throughput](https://github.com/Natasha-R/Process-Mining-Enhancement-Project/blob/main/4.%20Modelling%20Throughput.ipynb)

Further analysis was also completed using ProM (https://promtools.org/) and Celonis (https://www.celonis.com/), the details of which are described in the presentation slides.

Due to the large size of the initial event log it has not been included in this repository, however it is accessible via the link above.
